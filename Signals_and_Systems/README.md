## 📘 Mathematical Solutions

Some exercises required analytical/mathematical solutions rather than code. These solutions are included in this README file.

### Example: Θέμα Γ.1  
**A)** Σήμα συνεχούς χρόνου:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*x(t) = cos(100πt) + cos(200πt) + sin(500πt)*  

Για το παραπάνω σήμα έχουμε:  
- f₁ = 50 Hz  
- f₂ = 100 Hz  
- f₃ = 250 Hz  
(δεδομένου ότι ω = 2πf)

*… περισσότερες λύσεις soon.*

## 💻 Code (Matlab)

Coding was done using **Matlab**, and each script is named using the format `G.number.number`, corresponding to the exercise number.

All code files are uploaded and organized accordingly.
